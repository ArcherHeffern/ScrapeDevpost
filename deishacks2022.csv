The Homelessness Empathy Experience (CDCW),"
    Homeless people are not defined by their circumstances. This VR experience explains the systemic issues that leads to homelessness and can be used as a tool to increase funding for the CDCW.
  ",['https://player.vimeo.com/video/674133617?byline=0&portrait=0&title=0#t='],"We're all guilty of it-when we're rushing down the street and a homeless person starts asking for money, you simply ignore them and move on. A person who is homeless is much more than their circumstances, and should be treated as a person. There needs to be more empathy involved with the homeless. One does not simply become homeless because they're lazy, can't hold a job, etc. These issues need to be thrown out and we need to address the systemic issues that lead to homelessness.","Our virtual reality experience allows a person who has had the privilege of a roof over their heads for their whole life to feel what it's like to be homeless. We are aiming to bridge the gap between homelessness and empathy. Users are able to go into the first room, which shows some of the hardships that one faces before they become homeless. Room 2 shows what it is like to be living without a home.","Using Unity and C#, we built this Virtual Reality Experience. ",,We are super proud that we were able to create an entire VR experience in 48 hours. We are also excited for the ways that this can be implemented.,,"This project will be shown to the CDCW and will be used for a variety of purposes. It can be used to raise funds, as it can be a way to show granters what homeless is really like. It will also be used to jumpstart the forthcoming social media revamp and as a way for new volunteers to the shelter to better connect with their work.  ","['c#', 'unity']",
Circles: Media Engagement Hack-Waltham Partnership for Youth,"
    We designed a specialized media engagement platform, Circles, to bridge the gap between the youth and Waltham Partnership for Youth staff as well as urge students to expand their circle of influence.

As a team of diverse students who know the struggles of finding internships and opportunities, we personally related to WYP’s mission and wanted to help improve their presence and communication. We created the online, media engagement platform, Circles, to allow students to get connected without feeling like they are being held back by social barriers as well as enable access to opportunities for Waltham's youth. ","Circles targets the exposure of WYP online presence, external communication, and connecting youth to resources. Users are able to make a profile, share their personal circles of interest, and connect to staff, program leaders, and other students through an online forum. This will serve as a way for students to build their network and learn more about volunteer opportunities and educational internships. ","We communicated to the Board Fellow of WYP, Markia Neufville, to ask her about impeding improvements and issues they want to address with their WYP website. We have built the website for Circles using Html, CSS, SCSS, Dango, and Javascript to strengthen communication between the youth and staff in an interactive manner as well as urge students to expand their circle of influence.","Our biggest challenge was narrowing down a broad list of ideas we wanted to do. Partnering with WYP inspired us to think about the biggest problems that students often face and, therefore, we had many goals on our list that we wanted to achieve. Through the brainstorming process, we learned more about practicality, compromises, and time management. Another big challenge, we faced was developing the forum and messaging platform. However, with time, patience, and drive, this was accomplished.","We are proud of our team for being motivated to help social good and overturning the little stumbling blocks we faced throughout this hackathon. This was our first hackathon, so there were new challenges we have faced from learning how to participate in one in general and how it works. Building a website in two days is an accomplishment itself! So we are proud to come together for a cause, brainstorm new ideas, and build a method and a website to improve the presence of our nonprofit. ","We learned that working as a team towards a common goal makes anything possible - even within 2 days! We learned about the importance of time management, planning, and task delegation.

"CMe: Connect, Communicate, and Create","
    Members of OFI love making friends, but there is no way for them to meet others outside of OFI Waltham. CMe leverages the Arc network so they can connect, communicate, & create with their communities.
  ",['https://www.youtube.com/embed/97dw-WdIPZY?enablejsapi=1&hl=en_US&rel=0&start=&version=3&wmode=transparent'],"A few of our team members are on sports teams and have team impact players, who are members of I.D.D communities. These impact players get to be a part of the sports teams by going to practices, watching games, and even having a headshot on the rosters. Outside of this, the impact players love to message the Brandeis Athletes constantly on social media, but the athletes are too busy with sports and school to fully engage with them on a daily basis. Through this experience as well as speaking with Joanne Raymond, Director of Marketing and Development at OFI, our team decided to design an app that would address this gap of no social networking platforms for members of the I.D.D. communities.","CMe is an app where members of OFI and the Arc can connect, communicate, and create with people they identify with. CMe will allow OFI members to go beyond their Waltham program and access to members of over 600 other Arc locations. This app is not only safer than other forms of social media, but it is curated just for them. ",We mainly used Figma for sketching out the wireframe of our app. We also used Animaker to create our videos with an animation effect.,"Lack of time is the biggest challenge that we came across. Although the ultimate goal would be to develop an app, we decided to use wireframe to showcase the layout and functionalities of our app due to the 48-hour time constraint.","We are proud that we managed to create a good visualization of our plans and come up with a way for members of OFI to connect and communicate with people with similar life experiences and interests, which they wouldn’t be able to do in the past.","We learned how to split up the work efficiently within our team. We worked together on building up the conceptual model, and while Jolie and Sabrina focused on creating the narratives of the story and making the pitch video, Jared and Ellen designed the wireframe. We also developed new skills and learned to use tools like Figma and Animaker.",,"['animaker.com', 'figma.com']",['https://www.figma.com/file/B1QZjfTxVk3ZemOaOjo5g4/CMe_Wireframes?node-id=0%3A1']
MassIPL,"
    Project focused on a website redesign to help MassIPL reposition itself towards a broader audience.
  ",['https://www.youtube.com/embed/fkxfItkmRR4?enablejsapi=1&hl=en_US&rel=0&start=&version=3&wmode=transparent'],"Through conversation with the leaders at MassIPL, we learned that the organization is looking for more effective ways to increase the outreach of its energy-saving program to attract a more diverse pool of faith-based communities and individuals who care about climate justice. It also strives to be a thought leader in educating the faith-based communities on the necessity and benefits of reducing their carbon footprint. However, its current positioning makes the organization looks like a religious organization that serves a relatively exclusive group of houses of worship, which puts constraints on its ability to increase member diversity and gain access to funding channels. We quickly realized that these challenges present opportunities. We created a brand new website that showcases their unique secular position and an effective tool, the environmental stewardship calculator, that will drastically increase member engagements. ",,"MassIPL’s new website was created on Weebly. The design process started in Figma before we brought it to life through our development process. 
For the front-end of the new website, we build the main body of the website with the help of Weebly’s design capabilities. We then created links in between web pages to realize the design flow and make sure it is convenient and clear to the users. For the calculator, we built an algorithm that returns results based on the different variables.","It took us some time to figure out the correct logic behind the website design. Our goal was to make the website as easy to use as possible while getting our message across. The process of creating the calculator and incorporating it into the website was also a challenge as none of us had previous experience. The purpose of the calculator is to increase user engagement, so we wanted to make sure the questions we ask can do exactly that. Moreover, we were careful about finding the right balance between getting our image across as a secular organization and the fact that we are providing services to faith-based organizations. ","We are glad that we built a fresh website whose purpose and content complement the existing website well. It helps the organization to promote its secular image and brings in traffic from not only houses of worship, but also individuals who care about climate justice in general. 
We wanted to simplify facing the issue MassIPL addresses. The calculator was a key component is doing this because successfully tackling energy inefficiency can seem like a difficult mountain to climb but by basing our suggestions around each unique situation, houses of worship will be able to take incremental steps leading to substantial and sustainable impact which is our goal!","This is our first time working with Weebly to create a website. As with any new program, there was a steep learning curve, made more difficult by the short time period. Additionally, after Larry Goldberg's inspiring Keynote, we were prompted to explore how we could make our design as ADA compliant as possible and while this hack may not have been “Born Accessible”, a majority of the design components had been completed beforehand, edits were made prior to the implementation. 
Additionally, for half our team, this was the first time hearing about MassIPL and the bigger movement combating energy inefficiency. So we prioritized taking the time to educate ourselves about the connection between faith-based organizations and climate change and the different ways they can make an impact.  ",MassIPL will continue to do outreach to educate more and more houses of worship on their duties to protect the earth and help them one step at a time. We see MassIPL capable of wielding the power and support from faith-based communities to demand meaningful and impactful social and political changes. ,"['adobe', 'canva', 'figma', 'premiere', 'weebly']","['http://massiplinc.org', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LsJNpewQEDZgqfSGancTBU8bHZS9X-W-/view?usp=sharing']"

Charles River Museum Scavenger Hunt Map,"
    An interactive map that orients visitors around the museum.
  ","['//d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/001/825/369/datas/gallery.jpg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ucpczCWysV0?enablejsapi=1&hl=en_US&rel=0&start=&version=3&wmode=transparent', 'https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/001/825/369/datas/original.jpeg']","The Charles River Museum will reopen in April and the staff are trying to promote it as much as possible. Since the museum is difficult to find if you don't know the location well (even Google Maps doesn't lead you straight there!), we decided to turn this disadvantage into an attraction to tourists by integrating a scavenger hunt game with the map.","Our webpage contains a new map (a modified version of an older map) with directions for getting to the museum as well as the floorplan for the museum. Visitors can scan the QR code that will be posted at nearby parking lots and local businesses or at the museum entrance itself to get the map of the surrounding area with clear directions on how to get to the museum, as well as maps that show how to navigate both floors of the museum. By scanning QR codes placed throughout the museum in different exhibits, visitors will be able to access information about the exhibits on their phones and get a chance to find ""easter eggs""! Prizes will be awarded to those who successfully complete the scavenger hunt; these prizes will be small gifts like movie tickets and restaurant coupons donated by local businesses in exchange for promotion at the museum. We believe this collaboration with local businesses, especially other non-profits in the area, will promote mutually beneficial business within the community and will lead to future collaborations that could include co-hosting cultural events at the museum and/or more cross-promotional advertising between businesses with which we form partnerships. The map we created also highlights a few other local businesses to use as landmarks for finding the museum; this map could be redesigned in the future to be even more detailed and include more businesses. ","We based our interactive page on the Ruby on Rails framework and the static page using Webflow. We also imported a QR code generator, but it's up to the museum to decide whether they want to use a separate QR code generator or a built-in generator. We also made use of the websites freeonlinsurveys.com and wheelofnames.com to create our scavenger hunt quiz and wheel of fortune to generate randomized prizes. ","In the beginning, we had trouble figuring out how to create an easy-to-navigate map since even Google Maps was not accurate in locating the museum and how to get to its entrance. We decided to use QR codes to show visitors a simple map with clear walkways to the museum and QR codes within the museum to link users to different exhibits that would help them complete the scavenger hunt we created. Through this simplification of the map, we were able to achieve basic approximate user orientation while avoiding the technical difficulty of GPS location.","We were able to implement a website prototype within one day, and the website dynamic is such that museum's staff can change the map or edit exhibit information in the future. As a result, our product is easy to maintain, even for a crew who knows nothing about coding.
We also developed a marketing plan to collaborate with many local businesses in Waltham that we hope will benefit the entire local community along with the museum. ","We have gained much experience from building the website, including designing the UI and designing and implementing the database. We also had a great discussion with museum staff and mentors at the hackathon to learn about developing market proposals. We learned about how to run a non-profit organization and tried to explore the possibility of the operation of a social enterprise. ","The website UI is rather rudimentary right now. It needs to be upgraded to be even more user-friendly in the future, and it would be great if we could connect it with the museum's Virtual Matterport (the virtual reality version of the museum) in a more integrated way instead of by directing users only to links to this. 
It is also necessary to start reaching out to local restaurants and businesses near the museum to form partnerships and sponsorships.","['canvas', 'css', 'html', 'javascript', 'postgresql', 'ruby-on-rails', 'webflow']","['https://github.com/SusanLiiii/Museum_Map', 'https://afternoon-sands-83549.herokuapp.com/user/login', 'https://charles-river-museum.webflow.io/']"

Logos are the face of the organization because organizations may have similar names, but a logo will help any organization stand out from the rest.What else must an organization have to build their brand? In the digital age, a website. Websites are essentially the digital resume of the organization.

","We made the logo based on the current color theme and the mission of the website, with some adjustments to better suit the organization as a whole. We then organized all of the info that is currently on their website, grouping similar elements together in their own webpages. Lastly, we conveyed this visually through the use of Figma.","Our biggest challenge was concisely organizing the load of information the site had - particularly on the homepage. We found that there was too much info on the homepage, so much that it doesn't compel users to look at the other pages in the website.

We came up with a creative and effective solution that would connect these organizations through a website that could match nonprofits and for-profits together and create a line of communication. The website structure is inspired by dating applications because of the efficient way they allow people to meet to easily create a line of communication through one swipe.,"This website allows businesses to discover non-profits that align with their passions and values. After finding nonprofits that interest them, the business will be allowed to join the forum designated to that non-profit where nonprofits can communicate their needs and businesses can communicate back stating if they can fulfill their requests.","We created this website from scratch using a MERN stack (sans MongoDB due to time constraints) with Typescript. Backend development involved creating a structure of API routes, functions, and data structures for storing for-profits, non-profits, and forum logs. It was accomplished through Express and Node.js. Front-end development was done through a React app, using libraries such as Material-UI and react-router-dom.This project was written with Typescript, React, Material-UI, NodeJS, Express, and GitHub.","This project had a significant amount of technical coding involved. Due to time constraints, we were unable to fully implement some features we had envisioned, such as storing our database on MongoDB and a matching algorithm. A good amount of time was spent debugging and researching different packages, functions, and implementations that would best suit our needs.","We were given an issue (how to connect for-profits and nonprofits?) and we brainstormed, planned, and coded our way into the product we present here. We’re pretty proud of this.","Our team is composed of a diverse background of skills. Some of us learned about full stack development and the variety of packages, languages, and platforms that come with this programming. Some of us learned GitHub collaboration and how to pitch an engaging proposal. All of us learned what we can accomplish in 48 hours with a little (lot) of caffeine. ","We would like to create a matching algorithm that will refine user preferences by taking into account any filters the user chooses (i.e. nonprofits within a 10 mile radius, nonprofits in the “Research and Education” category) and the types of non-profits the user swipes left or right on. Our goal is to build an algorithm that will most efficiently align nonprofits with businesses’ values, passions, and missions.We would like to polish up the GUI aesthetically and functionally. Next steps include allowing non-profits to edit their own profile and forum posts, and allowing businesses to select preferred non-profit categories.We hope to connect the WCOC membership database with our user and non-profit database. This will allow non-profit WCOC members to automatically have a profile in the Nexus Connection, and allow for-profit WCOC members to gain access to this application. To help with security, we would like to create a login screen, where members of the chamber can login to access this networking program.","['css', 'express.js', 'github', 'html', 'material-ui', 'node.js', 'react', 'shell', 'typescript', 'vscode']",['https://github.com/chauchloe5/DeisHacksWCOC']

Auction donations lists companies that will donate high-demand items that can be auctioned by the non-profit for fundraising, and the meals & vouchers include resources for meal vouchers, food donations, and restaurant gift cards. Local grants lists companies that give small grants to nonprofits through the company’s local branches, and job resources lists available resources to assist in building workforce skills or finding apprenticeship opportunities.

","During research, we learned about Corporate Social Responsibility and In-Kind donations. We saw great potential for connecting these resources with the Haven Project. Through Corporate Social Responsibility programs, many large corporations give various types of donations to local nonprofits other than money. We learned that these are called “in-kind donations”. Our team decided we wanted to find a way to make it easy for the Haven Project to access the many in-kind donations that are available. Our team worked on gathering information about over 40 companies that participate in Corporate Social Responsibility programs. We created a database that listed the company names, the type of donations they make, descriptions of the donations, and all necessary steps to apply for and receive the donation. We filtered the donations by type so that the Haven Project can easily select which category of available donations they would like to view. The categories include clothing, meals & vouchers, auction donations, local grants, toiletries, and job resources. We implemented our database into a website using Wix website builder. All information from the database is accessible on the website. ","The largest challenge our team faced occurred when one of our team members exited the group fairly late into the event.

We have created a user-friendly and effective web interface that the Haven Project can use to access all of the resources we spent time researching. ,"Through determination, effective team-work, and creative problem solving, daunting challenges can be overcome.
