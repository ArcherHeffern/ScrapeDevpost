CRCH Telehealth OTTO Guide,"
    Our project is a webpage that aims to assist CRCH's elderly and LEP patients with the OTTO Telehealth service. It is a user-friendly website with multiple language translations available. 
  ",['https://www.youtube.com/embed/fmTSPPhN2pw?enablejsapi=1&hl=en_US&rel=0&start=&version=3&wmode=transparent'],"What inspired our project was seeing how only 6% of CRCH's patients preferred telehealth services as opposed to in-person and phone calls. We believe this was mainly due to language barriers since 60% of CRCH's patients require health services in a different language other than English. As many of us in our group come from families with non-English speaking backgrounds, we felt a personal connection to this issue. In addition, CRCH did not have a virtual visit guide on its website. ","Our webpage is an online resource for patients that are new to telehealth services. It includes a video and written step-by-step guide with screenshots of what the user will see during their telehealth visit. It is also available in Spanish currently and will be available in other languages soon. the website also includes a FAQs page that users can turn to to get general information on telehealth and OTTO, CRCH's telehealth service provider. ",We primarily used Weebly's free website building service. We also used Canvas to edit our pictures on our written guide and iMovie for our video guide. ,"Time management was our biggest challenge as this was a 48-hour hack. We didn't have enough time to put in all the languages we were hoping to and include a guide for Android users. However, these can be easily added in weeks to come. ",We are proud of the design of our website and how easy it is to navigate through. We are also proud of leveraging each group member's skill set. It was an amazing group project experience and has taught us a lot about what works to make projects like this successful. ,"We learned how to divide up work effectively and efficiently and other new group-work skills. We also learned how to use Weebly. In addition, from our research, we learned many new things regarding health services. ","The next steps for CRCH Telehealth OTTO Guide are being available in the most common languages CRCH patients speak, guides for different phone operating systems, and even more information on the FAQs page. In addition, we would like to add links to this site on CRCH's website as well as in their text message and email communications regarding virtual visits.

Land's Sake Farm Hack for Impact,"
    None of us have ever done a hackathon before, but we are proud of and Landâ€™s Sake is thrilled about our ideas as they are easily implementable and will make a difference from the moment the farm opens
  ",['https://player.vimeo.com/video/526978089?byline=0&portrait=0&title=0#t='],"From speaking with Beth and Pam, we know that most crucial is growing the Landâ€™s Sake community as this is central to their mission and to proving the benefits of their year round infrastructure and business model. It is hard to say we are growing without understanding where your baseline community is. This count information and these branding ideas will help Landâ€™s Sake develop a strategic growth plan as they enter their community funded capital campaign. Land's Sake is so inspirational as an organization and is especially important for the community in times of rapid climate change and hunger relief during the pandemic. We aimed to help in the largest capacity we could in this time frame while solving real and practical issues for the farm. Our biggest inspirations mid-project definitely came from each other, having fun with our different backgrounds, and bouncing off ideas!","Two part project
One
We designed a laser counter. Basically, a laser is shot across an opening and anytime someone passes, the digital counter will take a tally. It is a design open to battery or solar power. The weather resistant box housing the laser will then be mounted on existing poles at each of the three paths leading from the parking lot to various areas of the farm. The design and controls are simple, it is low cost, less than 100 dollars, and only requires a person to flip a switch each day. To get an accurate count, divide by 2 to account for entrance and exit. The blinking light each time someone passes through increase the counter.
Two
We also focused on branding as a way to understand and engage the community. The farm is open and welcome to everyone anytime they are open! Unlike many establishments in Weston you do not need membership to stop by. We focused on simplifying messages and including ""everyone/all"" in signage on the road as well as increasing online engagement through social media and organic search. (more in video!)",Above in part and watch video! Definite use of tinkercad for the laser element and its box (create a free acount to see deisgn elements). The sign we recreated in slides based on the built pieces they already have so that they do not need to focus on getting many more new materials!,Time for this form! :) Did not realize it would be part of the submission. Very difficult to encompass all of our work in three minutes of presentation. Had to drop one of our favorite parts of the project because it was the least implementable in the moment and we did not have time to include it in the presentation.,"We did this! Beth and Pam of Lands Sake are incredibly excited about it as well. Team dynamics were fabulous, too, though some have, we have not all worked together before!","Communication would be easier across just one platform versus 5 :) We had also never participated in a hackathon, sourced a team, used tinkercad, designed a circuit, nor a sign before!",Continuing to help the farm!,['tinkercad'],"['https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3sUSoMgQ4hf-spectacular-kieran-kasi/editel?sharecode=fVD2Kz0tReq2rkvqvo8YUlrryH0h83F24_oev65C34Q', 'https://www.tinkercad.com/things/66hqoJkkjYK-mighty-blorr-albar/edit?sharecode=PEQKwLd7GVd-EmQ-Qy2aXSdZfoAXlvlC6H7enAiyfVg']"

We designed the application in Figma before bringing it to life through our development process. It is fully responsive on both mobile, tablet, and web so anyone can use this website at any time - whether they are researching options at home or on the bus to work.The machine-learning algorithm allows users to enter information about their home and matches them with  3 heat coaches using a nearest-neighbor algorithm, so they can choose the coach who best suits their needs and preferences. The website is SEO optimized with Next, so someone looking up heat pumps would find our website and be able to learn more.The website is hosted on Netlify for easy deployment, while the API is hosted on Heroku.","The largest difficulty we had was designing a good website that was feasible to build within 24 hours. We had a lot of great design ideas, but it was very difficult to make something look beautiful and exactly how we wanted it within the span of DeisHacks.Additionally, we were trying to figure out a way to actually calculate the cost of a heat pump versus alternative options directly on our website to provide the best user experience. Unfortunately,  we were not able to devise an accurate algorithm, so we instead worked around that problem by linking to an external calculator.","We are proud that we were able to create a fully responsive website that connects to a fully-working machine learning algorithm. Additionally, our website is stunning and has a professional look to it, and actually gives the end user a call to action, which is the most important part. We wanted to simplify the process of getting connected with the HSA, as the best way to convince someone to get a heat pump is by actually talking to a friend or advocate.","This was the first time that we created a NextJS website that calls an externally hosted API. This was also our first time working with SVGs to create beautiful backgrounds, which caused a lot of difficulties. Additionally, we wanted to make sure that our app worked on all browsers, and so we had to do a lot of work due to how certain web elements (SVGs, number inputs) interact with web browsers such as Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. Additionally, for half of our team, this was the first time even hearing about heat pumps. There was a lot of learning that we had to do to educate ourselves about our users' needs and why this was important.","One thing we would like to do is provide HSA coaches with the ability to log in and see who they were matched with. Rather than the prospective owner reaching out, they can simply click a button that would say ""I would like to match with this user"" and it would connect to a backend database where the coach could log in, and see homeowners and their specified needs.We would also have liked to have incorporated the heat pump calculator directly on the website but had some difficulty finding the correct algorithm that calculates the cost of various heating functions.","['flask', 'heroku', 'material-ui', 'netlify', 'nextjs', 'python', 'react']","['https://heatpumpbuddy.netlify.app', 'http://www.github.com/mdodell/heatpumpbuddy', 'https://github.com/danielhariyanto/HeatPumpAPI']"

Users feel like theyâ€™re inside the museum and can navigate through the different exhibits. This virtual tour is perfect for two reasons. First, customers can visit safely while abiding the current health guidelines. Second, implementing Matterport expands the museum's reach to those outside the Waltham area, who might not have otherwise come to visit the museum. Escape Room: Users can tour the whole building and for certain exhibits, like the Boston Associates, we have embedded additional information that the user might be interested in. If customers want more information, they can click the hyperlinked section to go directly to the museum page, or watch the relevant video from the museumâ€™s Youtube channel. ","We taught ourselves new softwares, Matterport and Thinglink, to create our products. Both products were created primarily with 360 degree photographs of the Museum. We then used a combination of information we had curated from meetings with Museum representatives and the Museum website to add an educational element to both products. We also learned how to develop apps without code using bubble.io.",Learning new technology in a short time span was difficult. It was also more difficult to plan and coordinate in a virtual environment. ,We are most proud that we have successfully created two working products the Museum can incorporate on their website today.,We learned about the importance of having an adaptable plan that you can change as you encounter problems during the development process. ,The next step is for the CRMII to continue to innovate and expand their virtual offering.,"['bubble.io', 'matterport', 'thinglink']","['https://youtu.be/_9w0ikcdHqM', 'https://www.thinglink.com/scene/1429876795007565825', 'https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=k3nagRjg7zK', 'http://crmii-virtual-tour-marketplace.bubbleapps.io', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ziSln11jgNzLQyJX42cVeUSznfnUypXj/view?usp=sharing']"

b.  Event Listing â€“ Utilizing RSS feeds from local Boston resources that push local events happening around the Greater Boston area.
c.  Forms â€“ Links to all the forms students need, all in one place. Forms could include tax, employment, identification forms
d.  Survey â€“ A general mental and physical wellness survey.  Before that app, the BTPA could only collect this info twice, at the start of the class, and 6 weeks later at the end. They can now collect responses at will, beyond the time limits of the class.
e.  Mentorship â€“ Connect mentors and mentees on a more regular basis. Users can post messages, post to a wall, and keep in touch. All posts will have the ability to be done anonymously.
f.  Resources â€“ These include mental and physical health, safety, college prep, addiction, food insecurity links to help students and beyond help themselves.","The BTPA app utilizes JavaScript, Node.js, React Native, and AWS RDS. In back-end development, we created a custom API from scratch, utilized visual studio code, structured our database with SQL workbench, and other developer packages. We created a front-end mobile UI using react native and ARGON framework. We started with a wireframe template and customized it to make a model out features the BTPA would find valuable and then built it out.","We thought the app development process would be quicker and smoother. The biggest problem we ran into was meshing back end and front end architecture .

In addition, we were inspired to create a virtual food and clothing drive to provide humanitarian aid even with restrictions on in-person events during the COVID-19 pandemic. ","We ultimately re-developed the original Waltham Rotary Club website, re-integrated the color scheme, and included new features for all users. Waltham Rotary Clubâ€™s current plan lacks a diverse platform, which leads to a low participation and attendance rate during club meetings. With this new and improved website, we offer a myriad of attributes: streamlined communication between Waltham Rotary Club and their members through a feedback form, an Eventbrite-styled collection of upcoming events, and a donation platform in collaboration with local organizations, such as the Greater Boston Food Bank and Family Thrift.

Jobs for Inclusion,"
    Jobs for Inclusion allows people with disabilities and their job coaches to search for jobs based on their ideal working environment, allowing people to have more meaningful jobs and connections. 
  ",['https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMIHtxnpA7w?enablejsapi=1&hl=en_US&rel=0&start=&version=3&wmode=transparent'],"Opportunities for Inclusions is a community center for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. One of the ways they serve the community is by helping clients find and hold on to jobs. Employment is extra important for their clients because it provides them not only with income, but also an opportunity to use their skills and engage socially with the community. People with disabilities face extra challenges when applying for jobs as the typical job listings do not include specifics about environmental conditions that may affect the clients. Currently Lisa, the job employment specialist at Opportunities for Inclusion, relies on traditional job listings to place clients into jobs based on convenience such as location, transportation, or even just wherever there is a job opening. ","In order to help job seekers with disabilities and their job coaches connect with more meaningful jobs and increase job retention, we have created a supplementary tool to traditional job search platforms that allows job seekers to match with jobs based on their ideal working environment needs. Our tool will assign tags from a list of 9 default tags that are important to people with disabilities when finding jobs to job postings. Employees will take a situational assessment to identify which tags are their strengths and weaknesses. The 9 tags are people skills and interactions with customers, standing for extended periods, physically demanding, teamwork, manual dexterity, tactile stimuli (touch), fast paced, auditory stimuli (hearing), olfactory Stimuli (smell), and mental stimuli (organization, thinking fast). The platform then creates suggestions for job seekers based on best fit based on the tags and/ or by location. ","To begin with, the business team brainstormed the features of the tool. We designed a series of assessments based on our experience working with people with disabilities and understanding of the research process and survey design. After brain dumping all our ideas, we started to consolidate a plan that would be feasible to build and also solve the specific needs of our client. Jobs for Inclusion is built on a Django framework. We used HTML+CSS and Javascript to build the frontend with the goal of making the site as user-friendly as possible, and used Javascript to interface the database with user inputs.We also wanted to make intentional design elements when considering the users of the application. We created an interface that matched the design of the current website in order to allow for a seamless transition from main site to this web app.In addition, we designed the interface with all users in mind creating the least amount of barriers to overcome when using the forms. This includes high contrast font colors/background color, large font size, large buttons, and highlighting active input fields. According to web accessibility standards for web development, elements of our project earns a AAA, the highest rating awarded.","During this process our team pushed ourselves as coders trying to fit a somewhat complicated setup into 'production' in this short window of time, as well as communicating on a very new team and dividing responsibilities over zoom. ",We are proud of how we progressed from a group of strangers to a team in less than 2 days. We are also proud of building a platform that will help the OFI better serve its clients and help them find more meaningful and permanent job positions. ,"For most of the team this was our first time meeting, some of us had never been to a Hackathon before, and we were working together virtually, so one of the most important skills we learned in our short time together was communicating effectively and dividing our work efficiently. On the business side, we learned how to turn our abstract ideas into a clear plan that the programmers could use to build out the tool. On the tech side, we learned how to leverage each of our skill sets to rapidly build a platform. ","We plan on testing this tool with a cohort at Opportunities for Inclusion. Specifically, we want to identify whether the 9 tags we have selected are the most important, when or not this tool will actually improve job matches/ satisfaction, and the usability of the tool.  We would love to continue building out the siteâ€™s functionality by incorporating Google Maps API to display distances between job seekersâ€™ and job listingsâ€™ addresses and filter for usersâ€™ distance and public transit accessibility preferences. We would also like to use natural language processing to associate common job listings with automated tags to save employers and career coaches time. Incorporating either technology would require an additional 1-2 weeks of development and testing. ","['css', 'django', 'html5', 'javascript', 'python']",['https://hbarber2.github.io/OFI-Survey/']
